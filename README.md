# Block-Verse
Blockverse is a game that involves placing of blocks of different textures in a 3d scene. Players could chose textures from the scene from the images they provide from their file directory. Users can build different different shapes using blocks in this. This game is developed using python's ursina engine that allows 3d game development environment. Run main.py with the grass.png file in the same directory. Once you run the program the 3d view with grass blocks as flat base will be visible. Before placing any blocks, you need to chose a png image from the file directory. The png image will be used as a texture for the block you want to place in the 3d scene. Click R from the 3D scene to access the file directory and chose any png image from the file directory. Once chosen you will be directed back to the 3d scene where now you can place the block by right clicking on the grass blocks.

Requirement
Install ursina by running "pip install ursina" command in the terminal
